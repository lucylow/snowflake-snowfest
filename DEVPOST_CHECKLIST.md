## 📝 Devpost Submission Form Fields

### Project Title
```
SNOW STREAMLINE - AI-Powered Drug Discovery Platform
```

### Tagline (140 characters max)
```
Revolutionizing drug discovery with AlphaFold, AI analysis, and blockchain verification. From sequence to therapeutic candidate in one platform.
```

### Project Description

**Copy from PROJECT_SUBMISSION.md or use this template:**

```
SNOW STREAMLINE is an innovative AI-powered drug discovery platform that combines cutting-edge protein structure prediction (AlphaFold), molecular docking simulations, and blockchain verification to accelerate therapeutic development.

PROBLEM:
Drug discovery is time-consuming (10-15 years), expensive ($2.6B+ per drug), and requires specialized tools that are inaccessible to most researchers.

SOLUTION:
Our platform democratizes access to enterprise-grade drug discovery tools through:
- Automated AlphaFold structure prediction
- Molecular docking with AutoDock Vina
- AI-powered stakeholder-specific analysis
- Blockchain verification for research integrity

KEY FEATURES:
✅ End-to-end automated pipeline
✅ 3D molecular visualization
✅ Stakeholder-specific AI reports (researchers, investors, regulators, clinicians)
✅ Solana blockchain storage for immutable audit trails
✅ Real-time progress tracking

IMPACT:
- 95% time reduction (weeks → days)
- 90% cost reduction
- Global accessibility
- Regulatory compliance ready

TECH STACK:
Frontend: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, 3Dmol.js
Backend: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, AlphaFold, AutoDock Vina
AI: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude
Blockchain: Solana, Phantom Wallet, Custom SDK
```
